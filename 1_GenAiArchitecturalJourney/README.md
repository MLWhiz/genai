## Post summary

The post (published 2025-04-06, Part 1 of the GenAI series) traces LLM history from the 2017 Transformer paper to the Llama 4 announcement in April 2025. It walks through each milestone with its key idea: the Transformer's self-attention, GPT-1's decoder-only pre-training (117M parameters), BERT's bidirectional masked language modeling, GPT-2 (1.5B) and GPT-3 (175B) and the shift to zero-shot and few-shot learning, and the Chinchilla finding that parameters and training data should scale roughly equally (70B parameters on 1.4T tokens).

It then covers ChatGPT (instruction tuning plus RLHF, 100 million users in two months), Claude's Constitutional AI, the LLaMA family (a 13B model beating GPT-3 175B on most benchmarks, then a commercial license with LLaMA 2), Mixtral and mixture of experts, Gemini's native multimodality and 1M token context, and GPT-4o. The later sections cover reasoning models: OpenAI o1, Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking, DeepSeek-R1 (reinforcement learning with GRPO) and Claude 3.7 Sonnet's extended thinking.

The author adds short explanations of SwiGLU, RoPE and Grouped Query Attention along the way. The post closes with trends (scale, data quality, MoE efficiency, multimodality, reasoning, longer context, alignment) and open directions: better reasoning, tool use and agents, efficiency, and long-term memory. The papers listed in this folder are the references for the first twelve milestones.

### Key takeaways

- The Transformer is the one paper to read first, since almost every later model builds on it.
- Scaling worked, but Chinchilla showed that data matters as much as parameter count.
- Instruction tuning and RLHF turned base models into usable assistants.
- Mixture of experts and smaller well-trained models improved efficiency over raw size.
- Reasoning, tool use and longer context are the current directions.
